        <h1> About FTC</h1>
          <p> FIRST Tech Challenge, FTC, is the major competition that Team
          Shatterdome participates in. FTC is for any students from grade 7 to
          12 who are interested in robotics or any other STEM (Science, Technology,
          Engineering and Mathematics) subjects. One of the most important themes
          that FTC emphasizes is gracious professionalism: respecting each other
          during the competition. Fierce competition is very important in Korean
          society, but people don’t put as much emphasis on respect. FTC allowed
          us to gain the professionalism that made us to be able to cheer for the
          winning team even if we lose.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="team">
        <h1>FTC Teams</h1>
        <p>In Korean regional round, the maximum number of team members allowed
          is ten. However, in the world championship, we could see many teams
          with more than ten members. FTC teams also need one couch or mentor
          who supports the team if there are any problems. Once the team is
          registered, it enrolled with a four to five digit number that represents
          the team. (For Team Shatterdome, it is 8338.) The number doesn’t change,
          and teams use that number in every FTC competition. As mentioned above,
          gracious professionalism is the most important theme in FTC, so teams
          are eager to help out other teams. Most teams have their own Facebook
          pages to communicate with other teams and provide help for any struggling
          teams. In our first year of FTC, many other teams were willing to help us.
           They lent us TETRIX parts, or opened a practice field for us.
           Because the upcoming season is the second FTC year for us, we are
            planning to give back this benevolence by helping new teams.
        </p>

      <div class="game">
        <h1>How does the game work?</h1>
          <p>In September, the mission for the FTC is released, and the teams get
          busy preparing for the competition. The robot can be built with TETRIX,
          Lego, or MATRIX, and other additional materials can be used if they don’t
          violate the rules mentioned in the game manual. The programming is done
          with ROBOTC or LabVIEW. Every year, the missions are different, but the
          basic format of it stays the same – 30-second autonomous period and two
          minute driver-controlled period. In each match, four teams of two
          alliances, red and blue, compete. Teamwork is important because the
          alliances will be the teams that we have never worked together before.
          For scoring, there are two different types of points, QP (Qualifying
          Points), and RP (Ranking Points). Two points of QP is given for the
          team who won the match and one point for tying. RP is given in the
          amount of the score of the losing team in the match. QP is used to
          determine the rank, and RP is used as the tiebreakers. In the final
          elimination match, the highest-scoring teams from the qualification
          matches become the alliance captain and choses one or two other teams
          to become alliances. One last important rule – all teams must wear
          safety glasses in the game fields!
          <br>
          The regional rounds start in November, so the teams have two months to
          prepare. Each team has to compete in the regional rounds first, and the
          highest-scoring team gets to participate in the World Championship held
          in Saint Louis. Teams from various countries come and enjoy the World
          Championship.
